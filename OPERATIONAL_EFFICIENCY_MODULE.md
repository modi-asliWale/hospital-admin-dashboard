## Navigation

The module is accessible from the sidebar menu:
- **Menu Item:** Operational Efficiency
- **Icon:** Speed (gauge/speedometer icon)
- **Route:** `/operational-efficiency`

## Data Structure

### Mock Data Exports
- `equipmentUtilizationData` - Equipment metrics with utilization percentages
- `labTurnaroundData` - Lab test turnaround times and trends
- `pharmacyTurnaroundData` - Pharmacy order turnaround times
- `transportTimesData` - Transport service metrics
- `housekeepingTimesData` - Housekeeping service metrics
- `maintenanceOrdersData` - Maintenance order tracking data
- `resourceUtilizationData` - OR, ER, and lab utilization
- `serviceResponseData` - Service response time metrics
- `availabilityStatusData` - Real-time availability status
- `trendAnalysisData` - Historical trend data
- Color schemes for status indicators and priorities

## UI/UX Features

### Visual Elements
- Progress bars with color-coded status (success, warning, error)
- Trend indicators (up/down arrows)
- Status chips with custom colors
- Responsive grid layouts
- Interactive charts with tooltips

### Color Coding
- **Green (Success):** Optimal performance, on target
- **Yellow (Warning):** High utilization, approaching limits
- **Red (Error):** Critical status, over capacity
- **Blue (Info):** Normal operation, in use

### Responsive Design
